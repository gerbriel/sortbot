# ✅ Description Format Update - COMPLETE

## What Changed

Updated the Product Description Generator to use a **clean, professional vintage resale format** that matches your example.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Measurements First with ✠ Bullets**
```
✠ SIZE - Large
✠ PIT TO PIT - 23"
✠ LENGTH - 27"
```
- Now appears at TOP of description
- Uses ✠ character (not •)
- All caps labels

### 2. **Brand/Material Only When Mentioned**
- ✅ **Before**: AI always added brand even if not spoken
- ✅ **Now**: Only includes brand if you SAY it or TYPE it manually
- Same for materials - only added if explicitly mentioned

### 3. **Clean Natural Descriptions**
- Uses your actual voice description (cleaned up)
- No forced keywords or marketing fluff
- Adds construction details only if materials mentioned
- Natural flow: "Classic 1990s Nike crewneck featuring..."

### 4. **Professional Condition Grading**
- "Light vintage wear consistent with age." (Excellent)
- "Good vintage condition with moderate wear throughout." (Good)
- "Brand new with tags. Deadstock condition." (NWT)
- Clean, honest, professional

### 5. **Standard Disclaimers**
```
Condition shown in pictures. Minor signs of wear consistent with vintage age may not be individually listed.

High-quality piece suited for everyday wear or collection.

Next-day shipping.
All sales final.
```

### 6. **Hashtag-Style Tags**
- Lowercase, no spaces: `#nike #90s #crewneck #boxyfit`
- Only includes brand if mentioned in voice/manual input
- Adds style descriptors from voice (oversized, heavyweight, etc.)

### 7. **Better SEO Titles**
```
Large - Vintage 1990s Nike Crewneck Sweatshirt Embroidered Swoosh Minimal Athletic Navy/White
```
- Size first
- Era marker
- Brand (if mentioned)
- Category + descriptors
- Colorway at end

---
